# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Follow Up Analysis after failed Kickstarter campaign for the play Fever

### Background
In the following analysis, we will be continuing with the Kickstarter analysis of our friend Louise. This time, she has completed her Kickstarter campaign. It does not appear that she took any of our suggestions from the first analysis, unfortunately. It turns out that Louise still decided to proceed with her request of a $10,000 goal for her new play, Fever. As a result, she still fell short of that goal in fundraising. 

### Purpose
To further understand the successful vs failed outcomes of various campaigns, she wishes to view the analysis results of how different campaigns did in relation to campaign launch dates and fundraising goals. We will provide these results again in new charts to better explain our findings and provide further detail, and we will then finally conclude this analysis with limitations of the data recognized, if any, and further reiterate our recommendations in hopes that she will accept and apply our suggestions accordingly and achieve the results that she is looking for on her next fundraising attempt.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Louise wanted to know the results of the data for Theater Outcomes based on their launch dates to find out when is the best time to launch a campaign.

As we can see based on this image, the success plays were most successful in May, June, and July. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Louise also wanted a further depiction of the various play campaign goals against their actual campaign outcome.

The most successful campaigns were those whose campaigns were under $10,000. The campaigns with the greatest chance of success and minimal failure were those campaigns that remained under $5000. Once the campaign exceeds $5000, the success and failure gap begins to shrink, as demonstrated by the chart. Successful campaigns show up again for goals between 35,000 and 45,000 and then falls drastically again. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Currently, no challenges are identified based on these results.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
