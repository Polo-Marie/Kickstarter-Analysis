## Overview of Project
Follow Up Analysis after failed Kickstarter campaign for the play Fever




In the following analysis, we will be continuing with the Kickstarter analysis of our friend Louise. This time, she has completed her Kickstarter campaign. It does not appear that she took any of our suggestions from the first analysis, unfortunately. It turns out that Louise still decided to proceed with her request of a $10,000 goal for her new play, Fever. As a result, she still fell short of that goal in fundraising. 
To further understand the successful vs failed outcomes of various campaigns, she wishes to view the analysis results of how different campaigns did in relation to campaign launch dates and fundraising goals. We will provide these results again in new charts to better explain our findings and provide further detail, and we will then finally conclude this analysis with limitations of the data recognized, if any, and further reiterate our recommendations in hopes that she will accept and apply our suggestions accordingly and achieve the results that she is looking for on her next fundraising attempt.
